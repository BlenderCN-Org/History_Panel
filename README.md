Brings back the «History» panel with all its history managment including the famous Undo & Redo buttons. But with my polish pass on top.

Made for Blender 2.81 and above.

# What's different compared to the original one?

Nothing fancy, but it's got some weight, hence I call it "polish pass".

## Support of the "Undo History" in Sculpt mode
Since the sculpt mode couldn't generate any history steps in previous Blender version, this button was disabled when in sculpt mode. But since it's not broken in 2.8, I enabled back this button in sculpt mode.  

## Chose in which sidebar tab you want to insert the History panel
By default it pops in the "*Tool*" tab, but you can write down any tab you want, even a new one that doesn't exist.

## Icons
Because it's visual, and I like them. ♥
